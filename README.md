# Image Processing in Python

This repository focuses on image processing in Python. Here's a simplified overview:

1. **Introduction**: Learn to manipulate and analyze images using Python.

2. **Key Libraries**:
   - OpenCV: A powerful library for image processing.
   - Scikit-Image: Ideal for image segmentation and filters.

3. **Basic Image Operations**:
   - Loading and displaying images.
   - Image resizing, rotation, and cropping.
   - Changing image color spaces (e.g., grayscale, RGB).

4. **Image Filtering and Enhancement**:
   - Applying filters like blurring and sharpening.
   - Histogram equalization for enhancing contrast.

5. **Object Detection**:
   - Detecting objects in images using techniques like Haar cascades.
   - Implementing custom object detection with machine learning.

6. **Image Segmentation**:
   - Separating an image into distinct regions.
   - Useful for tasks like object recognition.
